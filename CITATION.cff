abstract: >-
  In version 5.0 of the OpenMP specification, the OpenMP Tools Interface
  (OMPT) was introduced, providing means to collect precise information
  about the application's use of OpenMP directives and lock routines.
  Although provided with a detailed specification, understanding and
  correctly handling the CPU execution model event sequence dispatched
  from various vendor's runtimes requires detailed analysis of events,
  their parameters and executing threads. To facilitate this analysis,
  we developed ompt-printf, an OMPT tool that allows for dumping
  execution model events and corresponding metadata for post-mortem
  inspection.
